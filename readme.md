## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, & Handlebars

**Dependencies used:** Express, Morgan, Mongoose, Materialize, Moment and so many more to add lateer

Followed MVC structure to ensure organization. Added Google OAuth for authentication.

## Optimizations

There are many things I'd like to add to this app:

* search by brewery 
* search by style
* local login (right now its just google auth)
* photos added to reviews
* rating system for beers (maybe stars)

## Lessons Learned:

So many things were learned here, keeping everying organized using MVC was a major emphasis. Adding the search function to search by beer and actually have it work was awesome! Handlebars is great, still working out the kinks with it though. Did not commit early enough and had some struggles with that. I should have uploaded the repo to github way earlier in the building process, I would have avoided many struggles.
